## Next Steps Required

### 1. EmailJS Account Setup
You need to create an EmailJS account and configure it:

1. **Sign up at [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)**
2. **Get your credentials**:
   - User ID (from Account > API Keys)
   - Create an Email Service (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) and get Service ID
   - Create an Email Template and get Template ID

### 2. Update Contact.jsx with Your Credentials
Replace the placeholder values in the `handleSubmit` function:

```javascript
emailjs.send(
  'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',      // ← Replace with your actual Service ID
  'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',     // ← Replace with your actual Template ID
  formData, 
  'YOUR_USER_ID'          // ← Replace with your actual User ID
)
```

### 3. Configure Email Template
Set up your EmailJS template with these variables:
- `{{name}}` - User's name
- `{{email}}` - User's email  
- `{{message}}` - User's message

### 4. Test the Form
